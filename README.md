## 🧾 TL;DR

- 🧠 Currently diving deep into machine learning fundamentals and experimenting with large language models for smarter tooling.
- 🛠️ Love designing clean REST/gRPC APIs, background workers, and data-intensive pipelines.
- 📈 Always hunting for performance wins—profiling queries, taming queues, and squeezing extra throughput out of infrastructure.
- 🔁 Shipping pragmatic CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Jenkins, plus containerizing services with Docker on GCP.

## 🧠 Focus & Learning

- **ML Foundations:** sharpening math intuition, building data workflows, and training/evaluating models end-to-end.
- **LLM Playground:** running open-source LLMs locally, comparing inference strategies, and crafting prompts/agents that are genuinely helpful.
- **Service Engineering:** evolving resilient microservices, async processing, and telemetry-rich observability stacks.

## 🧪 What I'm Experimenting With

- Prototyping personal LLM pipelines—trying different open-source and hosted models to streamline daily tasks (like the interview-debrief analyzer I built for myself).
- Exploring retrieval-augmented setups along with text2SQL, text2text, and audio2text models to boost research and automation workflows.
- Capturing what works (and what doesn't) so future me—and anyone following along—can reuse the best setups.
